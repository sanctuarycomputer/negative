A decade-long partnership between the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the GHG Protocol is working with businesses, governments, and environmental groups around the world to build a new generation of credible and effective programs for tackling climate change. It serves as the foundation for nearly every GHG standard and program in the world - from the International Standards Organization to The Climate Registry - as well as hundreds of GHG inventories prepared by individual companies.</span>

          We had calls with several third party consultancies, certification companies, and companies selling software tools that could help us collect our carbon emission data, provide analysis, recommend offsets to purchase, and become carbon neutral certified. The services were either incredibly expensive for a studio of our size or not quite what we were looking for, and most of the software tools were in their beta testing phase. Additionally, a lot of the data we would have to provide anyway, so we figure we might as well give it a shot first!
