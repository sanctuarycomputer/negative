        <p class="off-1 md:off-6 text-paragraph mb2_5 atlas md:col-6">
          When buying offsets, it's important the supplier can prove additionality - meaning they have an verification process that clearly shows that with this purchase, they are able to draw down more carbon out of the air. This most likely means you'll be buying carbon that was historically drawn down.
        </p>
        <p class="off-1 md:off-6 text-paragraph atlas md:col-6">
          We're generally wary of offsetters selling "futures" - that means they're selling carbon that will be drawn down at some point in the future. Unfortunately, this is what a lot of tree planting projects do. You'll be paying for a tree to be planted, and trading that for the total carbon that tree consumes throughout a 50+ year life time. Our planet doesn't have 50 years.

        <p class="off-1 md:off-6 text-paragraph atlas md:col-6">
          We're careful to buy Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and offsets that are in near proximity to us. Unfortunately, a lot of wind power RECs that are bought to offset electricity usage are from Texas, where wind energy is really cheap due to a deregulated market, and wide open land to build such farms. This ultimately hurts our environment: purchasing low-price RECs creates more demand, cheapening the price of carbon in Texas, and creating less incentive for suppliers in your home state to invest in clean technology.
